# Chicago-Hack
Our project is a web program called Next Horizons whose aim is assisting veterans returning from service. It provides a location-based college search if veterans want to continue or start to pursue higher education. It gives links to tips, tricks, and tutorials on how to make a great LinkedIn account in order to get a job soon after they return. If we had more time, it would also supply a list of available health and government benefits for the ones who come home injured or in a rough spot financially. We hope to facilitate social change by helping to rehabilitate veterans, because that has been a big issue recently.
